# Up to Day

Up to Day is a web application designed to help you manage small tasks that you can tackle when you have free time and don't know what to do next. It allows you to create tasks, categorize them into "Today" (tasks you want to focus on now) and "Later" (tasks you want to remember but aren't urgent), and easily check off or remove tasks as you go.

The application is ideal for those who want to stay organized without feeling overwhelmed, helping you prioritize and manage your time more effectively.
Explanation of the App Name

The name "Up to Day" is a play on the phrase "up to date" and the word "day".

- "Up to date" implies staying current, organized, and on top of things, which fits perfectly with the app's purpose of helping you manage tasks in real-time.
- "Day" refers to the daily nature of the tasks you are managing, emphasizing the focus on tasks that need to be completed today and those you plan to tackle later.

Together, "Up to Day" reflects the app's goal of helping you keep focused on the urgent tasks while also providing a simple way to not forget less prior tasks.
