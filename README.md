# Up to Day


Up to Day is a web application designed to help you manage small tasks that you can tackle when you have free time and don't know what to do next. It allows you to create tasks, categorize them into "Today" (tasks you want to focus on now) and "Later" (tasks you want to remember but aren't urgent), and easily check off or remove tasks as you go.

The application is ideal for those who want to stay organized without feeling overwhelmed, helping you prioritize and manage your time more effectively.
Explanation of the App Name

The name "Up to Day" is a play on the phrase "up to date" and the word "day".

- "Up to date" implies staying current, organized, and on top of things, which fits perfectly with the app's purpose of helping you manage tasks in real-time.
- "Day" refers to the daily nature of the tasks you are managing, emphasizing the focus on tasks that need to be completed today and those you plan to tackle later.

Together, "Up to Day" reflects the app's goal of helping you keep focused on the urgent tasks while also providing a simple way to not forget less prior tasks.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
